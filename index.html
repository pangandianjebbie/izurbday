            <h1>Hi Izzy</h1>
            <p>Happiest birthday, Iz! Thank you for sharing your beautiful laughter with us.
                You are a strong person, full of wonder, strength, and happiness. 
                Your quick-witted demeanor has brought us so much joy. Not only that, 
                but you are also a caring person who stands up when something crosses the 
                line or goes below the belt. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I appreciate your existence. I hope you achieve all your desires and goals in life.
                We believe in your capabilities and we are so proud of you! This is a simple birthday 
                card for you, Iz pasensya na static lang siya haha. Anyway, stay healthy and keep 
                being the sunshine personified that you are. Have a blast and stay pretty! 
                Love you, Izzycakes.
